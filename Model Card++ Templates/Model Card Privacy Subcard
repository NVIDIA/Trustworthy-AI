(For GPAIII ): During AI model development, strict adherence to copyright policy ensured compliance through risk mitigation and legal reviews. Post-data collection, reserved rights content is identified and removed, with verified opt-out processes for rightsholders. Detailed records document due diligence and transparency.
(For GPAI Models): We employ automated tools and data processing techniques [insert data scanned for here] during pre-training to identify and filter certain categories of personal information, including [insert taxonomy here].  Scans of [insert dataset names here] detected no PII.  
[Insert name of automated tool or data processing] indicated potential [insert finding here] such as [insert relevant example here] for which we removed using verified instances of PII using [insert tool or technique].
