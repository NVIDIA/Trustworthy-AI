(For GPAI Models): Tools used to assess statistical imbalances and highlight patterns that may introduce bias into AI models: | [These datasets, such as [insert name of datasets here], do not collectively or exhaustively represent all demographic groups (and proportionally therein).  For instance, [insert name of datasets here] do not contain explicit mentions of the following classes [insert relevant taxonomy].  [insert name of datasets here] contains [insert known proportional/representation split of appropriate taxonomy].  
To mitigate these , we recommend considering these [evaluation, fine-tuning, and mitigation techniques] to align with the desired model behavior.]
